\aboutme{About Me}{
	The power of machine learning (ML) has risen drastically over the last decade. Over time, we will likely see the growth of ML in all aspects of our lives, from health care to self-driving cars. I have begun to explore exciting new applications of ML in new domains such as medicine and civil engineering. I would like to help improve ML algorithms and extend them to new problems so they might do the most public good, and improve the quality of life for people worldwide.
	
  %Since starting a Ph.D. program in Fall 2016, I have already submitted a first-authored paper and helped write two grant proposals. The society-changing power of machine learning only continues to grow as I delve deeper into its potential. Hypothesis generation, the focus of my current research, highlights for me the potential machine learning has to improve human life and aid in scientific discovery. I hope to continue working to improve the quality of these system, and in turn, improve the quality of life for people worldwide.
  %I currently am interested in Machine Learning with applications in Civil Engineering and Medicine. I am incredibly interested in the potential that cross-disciplinary collaborations have to further science and benefit society. During my time at NERSC, I saw these sorts of projects and the type of work happening at our National Labs which inspired me to pursue similar work in my career.
